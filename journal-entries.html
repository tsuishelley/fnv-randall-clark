                        Just got back. Tired. Good scrounging along the way. Ended up dragging back a cart of stuff.<br><br>

                       Departed April 10th. Walk to SLC took 15 days. Would've been 7-9 back in the old days, but had to circle pockets of radiation and foraged along way.<br><br>
                        Don't know what I was thinking. Imagined I'd find my house, dig through rubble, find - something. Your bones I hoped, and Little Nut's. Would've buried them. Here in Zion maybe.<br><br>
                        SLC is mostly craters. Warped steel girders where highrises sat. Mounds of bricks.<br><br>
                       Never found our house. Didn’t even find street. What wasn’t a crater was scorched clean.<br><br>
                        Want to believe it was fast, a flash, both of you vaporized. Lies to make me feel better. I'll never know. Which part of city got hit first? Northeast and you both died in a blink. Farther away and you burned alive screaming or the blast broken glass and bits of brick and wood splinters shredding you like hamburger. Look at it coward and listen don't turn away face it. If you'd been brave lucky man you would've found a spot and blown your brains out.<br><br>
                       But not you. You took your time walking back, made a shopping trip of it. Scrounger.<br><br>
                        The truck was still there on the 77 north of Spanish Fork. The Chryslus too, but no sign of the old couple's bones.<br><br>
                        Outside Nephi I caught a trail. Three men, tracks heading toward Fountain Green. Thought about following but didn't. Stupid fantasy of friends, more likely cannibals.<br><br>

                        I count 28 of them. 11 adult males, 8 females, 9 children aged 2 - 10. Some rifles and pistols in bad repair. Old world clothes, ratty.<br><br>
                        September 22nd<br><br>
                        Got close enough last night to hear them talk. Spanish, I think. From Mexico?<br><br>
                        Heard them say "paradeeso" a bunch. Think that means paradise. Here to stay, then.<br><br>

                        The one I call "Maria" is pregnant. Think the father is "Jose" but she spends a lot of time with "Pablo" too.<br><br>

                        "Pedro" ran out to pee in the stream and would've seen me if he looked to his left. Too close. Need to give them space.<br><br>
                        November 10th<br><br>
                        "Jose" broke his leg chasing a bighorn. Too far from camp for them to hear. Told myself to leave it be but couldn't. 300 yards from their camp did my best Jose screaming imitation until a bunch of them came looking, then strung them along to the crest where they could hear the real Jose.<br><br>
                        Probably useless. Compound fracture, broke the skin.<br><br>

                        "Infec-shee-own." So many goddamn words nearly the same, think I'd be fluent. But anyway Jose's leg has got it so he's going to die. Nature for you. Of course they're giving prayer a try.<br><br>
                        November 12th<br><br>
                        Left bottle of antibiotics on a rock outside their camp last night. They thanked God (Dee-os) of course. As though that asshole saw fit to burn the world but still cared enough to leave some medicine on a rock.<br><br>
                        November 15th<br><br>

                        Fuckers killed all the men. I think they would've taken the women alive but Maria and Selena opened fire and some of the others went for their guns so they shot them down and some of the kids with them.<br><br>

                        Elena and Carmen and 5 children still alive, being kept in a pen.<br><br>
                        There are more than 100 of these assholes in blue suits. Every suit says "22" on the back. Why? Armed to the teeth with submachine guns, pistols. Estimate 60% male. Everyone seems to follow the dark-haired guy but can't get close enough to tell. Assholes are disciplined - patrols, sentries - they mean business.<br><br>
                        Say I go in at night and get the women and children out. Where to next?<br><br>

                        Are they sick? Lots of coughing fits. Tuberculosis?<br><br>

Have set traps all along entrance passage but if they find me it will be matter of time. Still, 24 confirmed kills in 10 days = at least 1/3rd their combat force, not bad for an old man.<br><br>

                        Lucky lucky lucky lucky. Patrol was small - 3 men. Screaming woke me - point man caught under deadfall. Panic fire ricocheted into the cave, almost hit me. Crawled forward and killed them all with SMGs. Nearly used frags, stupid, finger in pin when remembered ricochets.<br><br>
                        Leaving at once. No other patrols in area but they'll be searching narrows for these 3. Taking as much food as I can drag with me and heading to cave south.</p>

                        I think I can finally do it. Blow my fucking brains out all over this goddamn cave.</p>

                        10 sets of tracks 1/2 mile NE of canyon entrance. Barefoot???<br><br>

                        Saw them through scope. Corpses walking around. Finally gone crazy. Dementia maybe.<br><br>

                        I'm not crazy, they're real. Goddammit they are real.<br><br>
                        Rushed me the moment they saw me, snarling like animals. They look like corpses but don't smell rotted.<br><br>
                        I'll be putting them out of their misery. Doing for them what I never could for myself.<br><br>

                        Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, happy birthday you useless old dinosaur, happy birthday to me.<br><br>
                        Happy 60th. What do you get a man who has everything?<br><br>
                        A bottle of whiskey and a 12 gauge slug through the roof of the mouth! Whoo!<br><br>
                        Come now. What do I have to do to prove to myself that I've lived long enough?<br><br>
                        I'm a shriveled old man. White beard. Seen enough sunrises and sunsets. Saw the big sunset, been hanging on through the long night 36 years now. Ridiculous.<br><br>
                        Not kidding myself into thinking there's anything on the other side of this. Fine. Things weren't so bad before I was born.<br><br>

                        24 of them, half boys, half girls. Youngest is 8 maybe, oldest 13-14. Dirty and scrawny, been on foot a long time. Children's crusade.<br><br>
                        Struck camp on nearly the same spot as los mexicanos. 30 years and a lifetime ago.<br><br>
                        I've spent 2 nights listening to them. English. Literate. One of them reads stories while the little ones fall asleep.<br><br>
                        They escaped someplace they call "The School" but can't figure out where it was. When they want a little one to behave they tell him to stop or "The Principal will get you."<br><br>
                        Principal better not show up or I'll blow his goddamn head off. I can still shoot straight.</p>

                        I've been leaving notes for them, and gifts.<br><br>
                        They like the books. Started with stories but moved on to weapons manuals, medical books, practical stuff.<br><br>
                        In the notes, well it's embarrassing, almost like those cards people used to give to each other, everything sweet and loving. I tell them to read and to learn and to make the most of their new home. I tell them that I'm giving them Zion as a gift to make up for all the sorrows of their lives so far and all the sorrows man has visited on man. I tell them to be kind to each other and modest. I tell them never to hurt each other but that if someone else comes along and tries to hurt them to strike back with righteous anger. Stuff like that. I sign every note "The Father," because well, just because.<br><br>
                        January 18th<br><br>
                        Have I mentioned that I'm dying?<br><br>
                        Mind's still sharp. Lungs are the problem. Might be cancer. Cough's been getting worse for months, finally there's blood in it. Getting harder to visit my little friends, breath's so short.<br><br>
                        I've given away most of what I own. They'll find the rest in the caves when they get a little older.<br><br>
                        I don't want them to find me though. “The Father" is a broke-down old man? Disappointment.<br><br>
                        It's time. I don't want another birthday.<br><br>
                        January 23rd<br><br>
                        It's cold enough that I won't last long on the high mound up next to Red Gate. I think I've got enough breath left in me to make it. I'll just lie down and stare at the sky. Feels right.<br><br>
                        I hope they'll do well. I hope no harm comes to them, from within or without. Did my best to prepare them with the last few notes. Said something kind about each one of them, what makes each one special. Told them The Father was pleased by their kind natures and that it would be up to them to handle things on their own from now on, that I'd be silent but still watching and still caring.<br><br>
                        Lying, then. Oh yes.<br><br>
                        Lied to you, Char. And Alex. And Sylvie. Told you I'd be with you forever. But I wouldn't go back and unsay it once if I could.<br><br>
                        What was the point of it all? So many failures.<br><br>
                        But I never forgot your face. Or Little Nut's. Or (sorry) Sylvie's. They used to say that happened after a while but it never did for me.<br><br>
                        Maybe the only point of all this living was to keep those pictures in my head going for as long as I could. It was the only life I could give you. Not a day went by without.<br><br>
                        It wasn't choice. I chose to die again and again. Just never did. Body had its own drive.<br><br>
                        Well, the little ones will need it. Species will need it if it's to continue. That blind drive onward.<br><br>
                        I wish them well. It's been a gift to me, at the end of it all, to behold innocence.<br><br>
                        Goodbye, Zion.<br><br>
